Task Title: Time Series Modeling  

Objective 
To analyze and forecast the "Low" prices of a financial asset using statistical and machine learning techniques, including Holt-Winters, ARIMA, Auto ARIMA, and SARIMA models. This project aims to understand historical trends, address seasonality and stochastic components, and provide reliable predictions for informed decision-making.

Dataset Overview  

- Source: Historical stock prices dataset.  
- Target Variable: Low prices of the financial asset.  
- Preprocessing:  
  - Missing value handling using `sum(is.na)` and subset data creation.  
  - Date formatting and conversion for time series analysis.  
  - Created a time series object specifying frequency and start date.

Models Applied  

1. Holt-Winters Exponential Smoothing 
- Captures level and trend components (not focused on seasonality).  
- Forecasted 90 days ahead with clear visualizations.  
- Validation:  
  - Error metrics: MAE, RMSE, MAPE.  
  - Residual analysis using ACF plot and Ljung-Box test.  

2. ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average)  
- Differencing performed to ensure stationarity.  
- ACF and PACF plots used for parameter identification.  
- Residual analysis confirmed the model fit with minimal autocorrelation.  

3. Auto ARIMA 
- Automated parameter selection based on AIC and BIC.  
- Compared manually tuned ARIMA(0,1,1) and Auto ARIMA(2,1,2).  
- Produced 90-step forecasts with low RMSE and MAPE.  

4. SARIMA (Seasonal ARIMA)  
- Addressed seasonality effectively.  
- Provided stable predictions with minimized AIC/BIC values.  
- Residuals showed no significant autocorrelation.

Comparison of Models  

- Holt-Winters: Captured short-term patterns but limited seasonality modeling.  
- ARIMA: Modeled trends and autocorrelations effectively.  
- Auto ARIMA: Optimized parameter selection for accurate predictions.  
- SARIMA: Best performance for handling seasonality, offering the most robust and accurate forecasts.  

Recommendation: SARIMA is the preferred model due to its ability to handle seasonality and provide reliable predictions.

Instructions to Replicate  

1. Environment Setup  
   - Install necessary libraries: `forecast`, `TTR`, `stats`, `ggplot2`, and `Tidyverse` in R.  

2. Steps  
   - Load the dataset and preprocess (convert date column, handle missing values).  
   - Create the time series object and visualize the data.  
   - Apply the Holt-Winters, ARIMA, Auto ARIMA, and SARIMA models.  
   - Evaluate each model using error metrics and residual analysis.  
   - Visualize forecasts and compare model performance.  

3. Folder Structure  
   - `/data`: Contains the stock prices dataset.  
   - `/scripts`: R scripts for model application and evaluation.  
   - `/outputs`: Includes forecasts, residual plots, and model performance metrics.
